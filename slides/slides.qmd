::: notes
He uses Python and I love using R and we both work together. It is partially because of that that we decided to explore using quarto in our Data Science and Data Visualisation classes. This workshop is, then, an excuse to force us using it and learn by doing.

## About you {background-color="black" background-image="https://healthyschoolspa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kids-in-Class.jpeg" background-opacity="0.5"}

Let us know about your knowledge about quarto

1. Experts
2. Some degree of knowledge
3. Never used before, but I know what it is
3. I do not know what it is

::: aside

Usually, we'll be asking you to introduce yourselves, but given the large number of attendees, we have done that via [this github issue](https://github.com/WarwickCIM/quarto-workshop/issues/17).

**About us**

We are not Quarto experts!

We are not affiliated in any way to Quarto or Posit. We do not have any commercial interest.

We are just quarto users who want to share our progress and engage with other users in a co-creation process with an attitude of *healthy skepticism*.

. . .

**About the session**

This is not (just) a talk about quarto. Others have done it very well before[^1]. We will be presenting quarto's main claims and seeing how it compares to other alternatives.

. . .

**About the slides**

These slides have been created with quarto (of course!)
