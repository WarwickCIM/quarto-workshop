### Quarto references

You may want to read these quarto guides regarding [authoring with markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) and [using the article layout](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html).
:::

## Goal

To convert an example R markdown file to Quarto.

## Tools

### Used tools

IDE: RStudio, VS Code or vim

## Detailed Process

Explain here the process you followed to .accomplish your assigned task.

-   Step 1: Try compiling an example Quarto document:

    -   https://github.com/WarwickCIM/quarto-workshop/cases/template/documentation_template.qmd (File \> New File \> Quarto document).

    -   Quarto getting started instructions: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/. Hello world tutorial includes a Python chunk, so need pyenv and Jupyter to render document.

    -   Create New Quarto Document in RStudio.

-   Step 2: Try converting R markdown file to Quarto (https://jthomasmock.github.io/quarto-2hr-webinar/materials/02-authoring.html#/section)
    - In Section "Converting knitr chunks", mentions `knitr::convert_chunk_header()` function in dev version of knitr. Find that this is now in CRAN version, so update knitr.
    - Run `knitr::convert_chunk_header("doc.qmd", output = identity)`. Doesn't just update figure chunks options - converts R markdown chunk options to Quarto cell/chunk comments.

## Discussion

You can follow this outline

-   If just install Quarto, still need to install other requirements e.g. R, Rmarkdown, Jupyter, etc.
-   In VS Code, see qmd, Jupyter notebook showing output of different files (running within VS Code), when want to render document need another Jupyter installation (as running from the command line).
